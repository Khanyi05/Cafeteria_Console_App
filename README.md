Belgium Campus Cafeteria Discount Eligibility System
C# .NET Console App

A C# console application that helps Belgium Campus determine which students qualify for a high-performing student discount based on residency status, academic performance, and financial criteria.

ðŸ“Œ Features
âœ… Student Data Capture

Collects student details (name, residency status, years on campus, allowance, average marks).

Supports both residential and commuter students.

âœ… Discount Eligibility Check

Validates if a student qualifies for the discount based on:

Residency: Must be a residence student with >1 year on campus.

Academic Performance: Average mark > 85%.

Financial Constraint: Monthly allowance â‰¤ R1000.

âœ… Interactive Menu System

Enum-based menu for easy navigation:

Capture Student Details

Check Discount Qualification

Display Qualification Status

Exit Program

âœ… Input Validation & Error Handling

Ensures correct data types (e.g., numbers for marks, non-empty names).

Handles exceptions gracefully (e.g., invalid user input).
